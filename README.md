## Reflection

In my opinion, this entire project was done very well, there is not much room for improvement, the only thing I would change is the input system, it works well, however the current one works well.

The most challenging piece of code to write was the actual investment calculation, the instructions for the calculation were not straightforward, and more complex than they needed to be.

The most transferable skills were definitely the input validation, output formatting, and the use of a static class as a utility class.

This program is structured in a way that makes it easy to follow, and therefore easy to maintain, It is readable because of the different classes, and the use of a utility class, and adaptable for the same reasons.
